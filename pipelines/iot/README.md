# IoT Thermal Control Pipeline

This walkthrough uses the IoT example config to illustrate an end-to-end flow.

Config:
- `configs/iot_domain_config.yaml`

What it demonstrates:
- RAFT-style training data enrichment (optional).
- Inference-time RAG for live requests.
- Prompt structure and schema constraints.

Use it as an inspiration for new domains (pricing tables, rules, SOPs, etc).
